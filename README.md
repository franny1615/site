# Next.js Powered Webpage

## Description 

This is a basic next.js web application that serves as my portfolio site. It is meant to showcase projects that I have done in the past, and efforts I am making to familiarize myself with current technology stacks. 

### Structure
- next.js powers the backend 
- react/html/css power the front end visual
- react bootstrap makes certain elements look a bit more polished
- uses react-pdf to display pdf files

### Running the project

If for whatever reason this is downloaded, it can be ran through the terminal using the ```npm run dev``` command, given that node.js and next.js are installed on the system. You might also need to do the ```npm install``` command to get the node_modules folder for the project.
