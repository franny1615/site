# Next.js Powered Webpage

## Description 

This is a basic next.js web application with currently one page. It is meant to showcase projects that I have done in the past, and efforst I am making to familiarize myself with current technology stacks. 

### Structure
- next.js powers the backend 
- react/html/css power the front end visual
- react bootstrap makes certain elements look a bit more polished

### Running the project

If for whatever reason this is downloaded, it can be ran through the terminal using the ```npm run dev``` command, given that node.js and next.js are installed on the system.
